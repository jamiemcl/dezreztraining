# Task 5 (Its up to you)

This is a placeholder for us to discuss other steps you could take on top of the ones I have laid out.
You could:
* Implement a logger and investigate NLog (What Rezi uses) or Log4Net.
* Install ElasticSearch locally and create a basic ElasticSearch implementation using the basic domain model we have created.
* Install Redis Locally and create a cache service to store temporary data or to defer execution using redis pub/sub.
* (Feeling brave?) Implement FluentMigrator for more consitent DB schema migrations.
* Add some unit tests. (Rezi uses NUnit)
